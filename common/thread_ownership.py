"""
Thread ownership registry.

This is a lightweight best-effort guard for internal single-tenant deployments.
When internal API auth is enabled, we can optionally bind thread_ids to a
trusted user identity (e.g. injected by a reverse proxy) and prevent cross-user
access to sensitive thread-scoped endpoints.

Note: This registry is in-memory and process-local. For multi-worker deployments,
use a shared checkpointer/store and enforce access via persisted session state.
